# iCustomCue

Adds custom announcers to your corshair headphones

# For using packs

Just download the pack (comes in a .zip) and click "Install new pack"

# For making packs

### <b>Make sure your sound format for your soundpack files are signed 16-bit PCM 88200Hz mono wav files</b>

iCue is really picky about the file format. If you mess this up your sounds may sound like just loud noise.




## If you are using audacity,

* Click "Audio Setup", "Audio Settings", and change your project sample rate to 88200Hz
* Now exporting as a wav should do the job
